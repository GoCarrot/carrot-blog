[The 2013 PIE Class](http://www.geekwire.com/2013/meet-7-startups-portland-incubator-experiment/) was announced today and Carrot is thrilled to be on that list. We have relocated our office to Portland, and are getting acquainted with our classmates, and new surroundings.

### What is PIE?

Egg incubators are a warm, happy place for eggs to hatch into chickens. A startup incubator is a warm, happy place for startups to grow into businesses.

We are excited about the mentorship, advice, connections, and the great creative environment provided by PIE.

Also there is free beer, woot!
