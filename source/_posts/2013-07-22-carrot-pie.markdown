[The 2013 PIE Class](http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-30471-portland_incubator_experiment_announces_its_2013_class.html) was announced today and Carrot is thrilled to be on that list. We have relocated our office to Portland, and are getting acquainted with our classmates, and new surroundings.

### What is PIE?

Egg incubators are a warm, happy place for eggs to hatch into chickens. A startup incubator is a warm, happy place for startups to grow into businesses.

We are excited about the mentorship, advice, connections, and the great creative environment provided by PIE.

Also there is free beer, woot!
