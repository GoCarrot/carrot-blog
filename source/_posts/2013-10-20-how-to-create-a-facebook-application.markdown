If you want to allow users to log in to your app using Facebook, share using OpenGraph, send requests to their friends, or be listed in the [Facebook App Center](http://www.facebook.com/appcenter) you'll need to have a Facebook Application. 

Don't worry though, it only takes a few minutes to get a Facebook Application. 

### Let's get started!

**First you'll need to register as a Facebook Developer.** To do so, go to the [Facebook Developer Site](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).
{% img /images/register_developer.png %}
**Click 'Register as a Developer'.**

{% img /images/accept_terms.png %}
**Accept the terms.**

{% img /images/enter_number.png %}
**Enter your phone number to get a text from Facebook.** It'll take about 15 seconds to send the text message with your confirmation code. Enter the confirmation code you received.

Finally, go through Facebook's survey (or skip it). Now you're done, and you can create an app! If necessary, return to the [Facebook Developer Site](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).

### Create an App
{% img /images/create_app_button.png %}
**Click "+ Create New App" in the top right corner.**

**Enter your app's name in the text field.** 

**For the App Namespace**, try using your app's name in lowercase with only lowercase letters, dashes, and underscores. You'll need this if you want to share using OpenGraph or [Carrot](https://teak.io). 

**If you want to post scores or achievements to Facebook you must select 'Games' as your category.** In general it's a good idea to select the category that best suits your app, as that's where you'll show up in the Facebook App Center.

**Enter the captcha and click 'Continue'. Now you have a Facebook Application!**

In the next post we'll help you set your Facebook Application up so you can use it with your native iOS or Android App.
In the final post of this series we'll help you prepare your application to be submitted to the Facebook App Center.
