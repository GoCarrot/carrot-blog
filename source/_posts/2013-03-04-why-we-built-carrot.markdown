Last year I was working on an iOS game called Refuge. As part of the planning for release on the App Store we ran into a problem: __How do we get the word out about our game?__

We knew Refuge was fun. It was similar to Space Invaders with an added mechanic where players scored higher as they comboed alien kills, and bounced shots off walls. But how could we get noticed, and how would we grow? The mobile market is crowded, and more apps get released every day.

### What we needed was Carrot, but it didn't exist yet.

It's not enough for developers to find users, and keep users; those __users need to generate more users.__

After watching Spotify explode with new users Mark, our Creative Director, said, "I want our game to do that." Spotify was using Facebook's new Open Graph actions. This wasn't the hated 'wall spam' that plagued the early days of Facebook, this was a different way of getting the message out about what an app does, and how your friends use it. This was social proof, advertising and viral marketing all slammed into one! __Why wasn't everyone using this!?__

### "Getting carried away"

We dove into Open Graph. Here was the ability highlight every attractive thing that our game did, every cool action our users performed. It was fun seeing our test posts mixed into the Facebook experience, as though they were every day stories.

Alex, (our CTO, who might be a secret masochist) enjoyed fighting through out of date documentation, confusing Facebook API calls, and poorly designed workflows. He built out a data-driven server platform, and I started writing native SDKs for iOS and Android.

Then Mark thought we needed an editing interface so he could edit the posts without having to update the app build. By the end of the process we had built out a WYSIWYG tool that allows you to create and manage Open Graph stories.

__We were so excited by what we had built that we put our game on the back burner, and called this new tool 'Carrot'.__

### We built Carrot to make users attract more users.

Since then we've made some great progress:

* You can use our debugging tools to track down issues in your virals, so you don't have to wonder if something is broken.
* Our customers can do test posts for actions right from the web UI, to let marketing managers preview exactly how their content will be seen.
* We're working on partnerships with some of the top players in the mobile spaces of tools, metrics, and customer acquisition.
* Our seed funding round is progressing nicely.

We believe we can help developers get more users in their apps, and make those users generate more users. __We're building a company that measures its success on the success of our customers.__ Making a profitable business out of making our customers more profitable, that's a good place to be.
