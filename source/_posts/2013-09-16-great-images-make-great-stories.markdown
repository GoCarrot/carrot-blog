  Facebook's Open Graph channel is all about content, but sometimes the formatting requirements can be confusing. We'll show you how Facebook uses different image sizes, and how your content will be cropped for different display formats.
</p>
### Facebook's New Timeline Format
Facebook is slowly rolling out the new format for Open Graph stories with a big focus on content, your content!

Pretty cool, huh? Your app's Open Graph stories are going to get a lot more screen space devoted to them and that means that now, more than ever, __you need to make your images rock__, and Carrot is here to help!

While this new format for Open Graph stories is still only available to a limited number of profiles, Facebook rolled out this format for displaying the content of shared links to all profiles today. This means that Open Graph stories will share the same kind of formatting.

### By the Numbers
To be ready to take advantage of this new format (once it's rolled out), you need to __make sure that your images use a 1.91 : 1 aspect ratio__. Facebook will display your image using aspect ratios which range from 1.90-1.92 : 1, so using 1.91 : 1 is your best bet.

You also need to make sure that your images are at least 600x315, but you should __use 1200x630 for best display on retina devices__.

### Cool, but What About Now?
Looking ahead is great, but what about the time before a full rollout to all Facebook users? Understanding how Facebook crops images is essential to making sure you __get optimal display for your content on all existing and future formats__.

We did some tests to show you how images will display in a variety of formats by using a [test pattern](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/RCA_Indian_Head_test_pattern.JPG).

### The Takeaway
You can __prepare now__ for the new Open Graph image format by uploading images that are at least 600x315 (1.92 : 1 aspect ratio) to Carrot for your objects.

Until all Facebook users get the new image format for Open Graph stories your images will be cropped. You can make sure that your content doesn't get cut off by looking at the results of our tests and keeping your content right in the center.
