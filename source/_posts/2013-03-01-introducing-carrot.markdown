<p class="lead">Marketing on Facebook is a huge opportunity for app developers. Unfortunately, there are a lot of ways to get it wrong. We want to help you do it right.</p>

So, weâ€™re introducing __Carrot: A viral user aquisition platform__ for web and mobile apps. 

* Viral growth is a strategy and it should be treated like one.  
* The core value of your app should be central to your strategy.
* Iterating on marketing should not be tied to app releases.  

### What does this mean?

Your users are doing interesting things that have the potential to __attract more users.__ We enable you to turn those moments into social marketing. We put the story of your users and your app, __center stage in the Facebook experience.__ 

We enable your marketing team to __measure and learn__ how those stories are performing so you can update and improve them without developer help. 

We will explain more in the weeks to come, but for now, here are some of the types of custom story posts that __your app can use to grow.__
