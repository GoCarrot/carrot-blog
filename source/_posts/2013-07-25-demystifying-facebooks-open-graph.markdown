[Spicy Horse Games](http://www.spicyhorse.com/) is the largest independent game developer in Shanghai. Founded in 2007 by [American McGee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_McGee) they have developed 8 games for a range of platforms including PC, Mobile, Facebook and Xbox30/PS3.

When Spicy Horse first approached Carrot they had a problem: a consultant had told them to use Open Graph, but they weren't sure what it was. We explained the technology, the opportunity offered by Open Graph, and the advantages of using Carrot as a solution.

### What they did

Spicy Horse examined the actions that a player could take in their game, and started to think about which ones told the story of the game.

By using Carrot's web tools, the marketing team in the US was able to easly create the Open Graph actions that told the story of their game.

The marketing team was then able to co-ordinate with the Shanghai team to get art assets, and then use our "Download Code" button to generate the integration details for the programmers.

### What Spicy Horse has to say about Carrot

{% blockquote American McGee, %}
In our experience, Carrot is to player acquisition and retention what canned spinach is to Popeye. Unlike canned spinach, opening, integrating and maintaining Carrot doesn't require special tools or herculean squeezing power. It's a fast install, fast results super-charger for your online and mobile games.
