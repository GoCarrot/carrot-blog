<p class="lead foo">Are you an early adopter? Do you have an app? Do you want to see if Facebook sharing will attract new users?</p>

We've got several early adopters working with us now. Their Carrot posts are getting __better click through rates__ than banner advertising. It's really cool. 

But, we need more data on ways to make this service even better, so our __[public beta is open](https://teak.io/developers/sign_up?referrer=blog)__ for business.

We are actively seeking early adopters who want to experiment with a new platform designed to help them grow using __frictionless Facebook sharing.__

If you have an app where users __adopt cute kittens__, the posts from your app could look like this:

Pat loves his cats. 

Or, let's say you have a game where your __users get high scores__. How about fostering a little friendly competition with posts like this?

If you implement high score posts, I personally volunteer to play your game and get a better score than Pat does.

Maybe your app isn't a game. You have an app where __users send cards__. Your posts might look something like this: 

<figure class="thumbnail">

Alex is very considerate. 

__If this gives you ideas__ for stories that your app might share on Facebook, then you are a perfect candidate for our open beta.

<ol>
  <li>Enable your users to post Facebook</li>
  <li>Use our tools to measure and make those posts better</li>
</ol>

Our early adopters are helping us define and refine the tools we are building. If you like being on the cutting edge, and want to __give us input on the tools you would like to see__, then jump into the beta.
