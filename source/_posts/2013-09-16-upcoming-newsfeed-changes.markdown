  Facebook is updating the way Open Graph stories are displayed in the newsfeed. We'll help you understand what these changes are and how they will affect your content.

### Facebook's New Timeline Format
Facebook is in the process of rolling out the new format for Open Graph stories with a big focus on content, your content!

Pretty cool, huh? Your app's Open Graph stories are going to get a lot more screen space devoted to them and that means that now, more than ever, __you need to make your images rock__!

### In Brief
* Make your images 1200x630
* Keep your content in the center

### What About Cropping?
We did some tests to show you how images will display in a variety of formats by using a [test pattern](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/RCA_Indian_Head_test_pattern.JPG).

#### Upcoming newsfeed format

#### The existing large image format
<figure class="thumbnail">
  {% img /images/test_pattern_lg_sq.png %}
  <figcaption>Desktop</figcaption>
</figure>
#### The existing small image format,
<figure class="thumbnail">
  {% img /images/test_pattern_sm_sq.png %}
  <figcaption>Desktop</figcaption>
</figure>
#### The existing mobile image format
<figure class="thumbnail">
  {% img /images/test_pattern_mobile.png %}
  <figcaption>iPhone</figcaption>
</figure>

### The Takeaway
You can __prepare now__ for the new Open Graph image format by using images that are 1200x630.

Until all Facebook users get the new image format for Open Graph stories your images will be cropped. You can make sure that your content doesn't get cut off by looking at the results of our tests and __keep your content in the center__.
