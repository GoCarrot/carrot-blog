	Spicy Horse Games approached Carrot to help them add Open Graph Stories to their game. The results speak for themselves.

	"In our experience, Carrot is to player acquisition and retention what canned spinach is to Popeye. Unlike canned spinach, opening, integrating and maintaining Carrot doesn't require special tools or herculean squeezing power. It's a fast install, fast results super-charger for your online and mobile games."

### Background

<figure class="pull-right">
  {% img /images/Spicy_Horse_logo.png 115 100 Spicy Horse Games %}
</figure>
[Spicy Horse Games](http://www.spicyhorse.com/) is the largest independent game developer in Shanghai. Founded in 2007 by [American McGee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_McGee), they have developed 8 games for a range of platforms including PC, Mobile, Facebook and Xbox30/PS3.

### Goals 

Spicy Horse had two medium sized Facebook games that needed a boost. The goal was to increase the visibility of the games and also encourage the use of premium content. They also had limited developer time to devote to the task. 

### Approach

Use **frictionless sharing and Open Graph Stories** to allow fans to spread the word out the games.

</figure>

To **increase visibility**, Spicy Horse found stories that represent the core actions in their app. Ideally, these stories should be **shared at least once per game session**. 

In [BigHead BASH](https://apps.facebook.com/bigheadbash/?&ref=carrot_blog) players "play maps," "get weapons," and "earn action awards" in the course of a gaming session. 

Since these tasks are frequently accomplished, they are ideal story candidates. Additionally, because they broadcast what players *actually do* in the game, they turn out to be effective marketing.

  <figcaption>Highlight the use of premium content.</figcaption>
</figure>

To **encourage premium content use**, stories highlight when players use an item that costs in-game currency.

In [Crazy Fairies](https://apps.facebook.com/crazy-fairies/?&ref=carrot_blog) there are cosmetic upgrades that players can use to personalize their experience. Stories get triggered when players use these items.

Spicy Horse's Community and Marketing Manager, Kelly, created the stories using Carrot. Using the "download code" button she was able to generate a document that contained the code her programming team needed to trigger the stories.

Developer time for integration was less than a day. Once set up, Kelly had the creative control she needed to do tests and experiments without bothering the developers for changes.

### Results

Since integrating Carrot into [BigHead BASH](https://apps.facebook.com/bigheadbash/?&ref=carrot_blog) and [Crazy Fairies](https://apps.facebook.com/crazy-fairies/?&ref=carrot_blog), Spicy Horse has seen impressive results.

* **1.5M** impressions
* **5,500** clicks
* **6% conversion** increase

In summary: **For each day of the month, for every 5 players that played, 1 new player was acquired**.

### Conclusion 

Spicy Horse was thrilled with the results of using Open Graph Stories through Carrot. **They were able to increase their audience, revenue and overall app ratings with minimal investment.** They were also able to reduce their marketing spend by switching from display ads to more effective social posts.

American McGee was so pleased with the the results, he instructed Kelly to come to our office and buy us lunch. **We had waffles. They were delicious.** Thanks, American.
