If your app is struggling to monetize, take a look at your average session time. Average session time is strongly correlated to average revenue per user. One of the fastest ways to improve your average session time is to tweak your UI to let the player get to the core game loop faster.

While in free to play games we may want to push players to the shop or otherwise give them reasons to spend, we shouldn't forget that the player just wants to play the game. By giving the player quick and friendly ways to enter the core game loop, you can skyrocket session times.

Here's an example of a small change made by one of their customers that *doubled* their average session time. Before when a player first loaded the game, they saw this screen.

Notice that the only way into the core game loop is a 30x87 button which is highlighted green. Even if the player were to spot it, it's unclear if this is the section that the player is already on, or if it's the section the player should switch to.

Now when a player loads the game, they see this screen.
{% img /images/new_game_ui.png Addition of a 170x75 Play Now button %}

The addition of the 170x75 Play Now button in the menu, which expands on hover, *doubled* average session time. Check out the graph:

Our customer has more improvements to make. They will soon center the menu and provide more menu items related to the core game loop, which should further increase average session time.

So remember: If you're struggling to monetize, check out average session time. You might accidentally have an unfriendly UI which is driving players away. Small improvements that drive players into the core game loop can have significant effects!
